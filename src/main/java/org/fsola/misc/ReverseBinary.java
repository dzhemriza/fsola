/**
 * Yi has moved to Sweden and now goes to school here. The first years of
 * schooling she got in China, and the curricula do not match completely
 * in the two countries. Yi likes mathematics, but nowâ€¦ The teacher explains
 * the algorithm for subtraction on the board, and Yi is bored. Maybe it is
 * possible to perform the same calculations on the numbers corresponding to
 * the reversed binary representations of the numbers on the board? Yi dreams
 * away and starts constructing a program that reverses the binary
 * representation, in her mind. As soon as the lecture ends, she will go home
 * and write it on her computer.
 * <p>
 * TASK
 * <p>
 * Your task will be to write a program for reversing numbers in binary. For
 * instance, the binary representation of 13 is 1101, and reversing it gives
 * 1011, which corresponds to number 11.
 * <p>
 * Used Resources: README file resources section line 65.
